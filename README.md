# US Facebook News Sources Dataset -- WWW Submission 

Welcome to the News Outlets dataset! Here you will find a comprehensive list of (mostly U.S.) news sources operating on Facebook. This list contains well-known established news domains as well as under-the-radar Facebook pages that assert themselves as news providers.

In total, we have gathered 12,638 distinct news domains associated with 14,451 Facebook pages. These news sources, along 
with their corresponding Facebook pages, are actively monitored by our monitoring tool to collect the news-related posts 
received by users. 


# Dataset Description

The dataset contains two types of news outlets:

## 1. Established News Sites: 
These are news outlets that have been extensively reviewed and surveyed by independent data providers, namely News Guard and Media Bias Fact Check. The Established News Sites list contains 4,149 news domains associated with 4,323 Facebook pages.

## 2. Under-the-Radar News Sites: 
This list includes web domains that are linked to Facebook pages claiming to be news organizations, irrespective of their reputation and popularity. It includes all Facebook pages that promoted political ads on Facebook from June 2018 to June 2020 and identified themselves as "News Media." Additionally, we extracted the corresponding websites mentioned in the "About" sections of these Facebook pages. The list contains 8,489 distinct domains associated with 10,128 Facebook pages.
